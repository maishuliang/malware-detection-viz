<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
Nowadays, Android is dominating the smartphone market as an open source and customizable operating system. 
Many hackers targeted Android applications by disseminating malwares, posing serious threats to users. 
Historically, mobile security products such as Norton and Lookout, are heavily relied upon as major defense against such threats. 
Recently, many machine learning based methods have been invented for malware detection.
 A successful one of them is creating features from a Heterogeneous Information Network (HinDroid).
However, it is confined in such a way that it ignores more comprehensive information which can be extracted from graph representation. 
In this project, we will explore different meta-paths and incorporate various graph embedding methods in the task of malware prediction.
We propose to build upon our previous work in HinDroid replication, more specifically we will attempt to use deep 
learning graph embedding techniques. The success of this project will not only be determined by the performance of our final model but more 
importantly the evaluation of different graph embedding methods and further reasoning on the result.
